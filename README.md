A Starter Project for developing WordPress Site Themes based on Foundation CSS by Zurb Foundation. CodeKit compiles them. It is a derivative of the dev-dragon template.

### Please remember to;
- run npm install for node packages
- change the fonts and theme to the site you want to work on
- change the proxy of the browser_server function to the URL of the site you are working on (it should correspond with your local URL).
